# Babylon Node Docker Setup

This project contains the setup for running a Babylon Node within a Ubuntu Docker container. It includes the Dockerfile for building the image and the
docker-compose.yml for easy setup and management. This project is based on the excellent article
from [BreizhNode](https://medium.com/@breizh-node/babylon-lancez-votre-n%C5%93ud-validateur-en-quelques-%C3%A9tapes-simples-fr-en-deb8084d2b22).

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- A good internet connection for downloading dependencies
- Consequent amount of space on your hard drive / SSD (dozen of GB)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository and setup env

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Trustia-labs/babylone-node.git
cd babylone-node
```

Duplicate the `.env.example` file and customize the `NODE_NAME` env variable for your node name.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

### Step 2: Build and Run the Container

In the project directory, use Docker Compose to build and start the Babylon Node.

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This command builds the Docker image if it hasn't been built and starts the container in detached mode.

### Step 3: Verify Container is Running

Check that the container is running successfully.

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see your babylon-node container listed.

# Post-Installation Steps

After the container is up and running, you'll need to perform a few steps inside the container to finalize the setup.

Accessing the Container

Enter the container using the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it babylon-node /bin/bash
```

# Creating a Wallet and register your node

## Check Node Synchronization

Before creating your wallet, ensure the node is fully synchronized with the network.

```bash
babylond status | jq '.sync_info.catching_up'
```

Wait until the catching_up value is `false`, indicating synchronization is complete.

Note that even when you reach the block indicated as current on the explorers, it can still continue for a few blocks (like 50) before finally moving
to `false`. Just be patient.

## Create Wallet

Create a new wallet by running:

```bash
babylond keys add wallet
```

Follow the prompts to secure your wallet.

## Linking Wallet and Configuring Node

Link Wallet
Replace <WALLET> with your wallet's address to link it.

```bash
babylond create-bls-key <WALLET_ADDRESS>
```

### Configure config.toml

Adjust the timeout commit to 30s for better performance.

```bash
sed -i 's/^timeout_commit\s*=.*/timeout_commit = "30s"/' ~/.babylond/config/config.toml
```

## Registering the Node

Before registering your node, ensure you have at least 1 $BBN in your wallet. You can find some
instructions [here](https://www.binance.com/en-ZA/square/post/4606771072186). Be patient, the faucet can take sometimes 3 to 6 hours to deliver when crowded.
This is a very long process, and it can take easily more than one week to gather the required 1 $BBN.

- Check Wallet Balance : Visit Babylon Explorers and enter your wallet address to verify your balance. Alternatively, you can go directly
  to [https://testnet.babylon.explorers.guru/account/<YOUR_ADDRESS>](https://testnet.babylon.explorers.guru/account/bbn186m9t6ctz2z0f507yf63406cufl4e0ftgkndvx)
- Create Validator Profile : Create your validator profile in .babylond/config/validator.json. Replace placeholders with your information.

```bash
 touch .babylond/config/validator.json
 nano .babylond/config/validator.json
```

The content should be as follows (replace the placeholders):

```json
{
  "pubkey": "<PUBLIC_KEY>",
  "amount": "1000000ubbn",
  "moniker": "<NAME>",
  "website": "<WEBSITE>",
  "details": "<DESCRIPTION>",
  "commission-rate": "0.10",
  "commission-max-rate": "0.20",
  "commission-max-change-rate": "0.01",
  "min-self-delegation": "1"
}
```

- The `PUBLIC_KEY` comes from your previously generated wallet. It should looks like this (don't include the simple quotes):

```json
{
  "pubkey": {
    "@type": "/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey",
    "key": "GXU4XLhtIYE3iTAjx+CYa6XOquFrEvaw8ydH8nl/h1Y="
  }
}
```

- The moniker is your chosen nickname

## Register Node as Validator

Run the following command:

```bash
babylond tx checkpointing create-validator .babylond/config/validator.json --chain-id="bbn-test-3" --gas="auto" --gas-adjustment="1.5" --gas-prices="0.025ubbn" --from=wallet
```

I advise you to write down your TX and your valorp address somewhere.

It will take at least 30 min to show up anywhere, don't panic!
As long this command returns nothing, you still have to wait:

```bash
babylond query tendermint-validator-set | grep "$(babylond tendermint show-address)"
```

Additionally, your valorp address and your moniker won't give any result on the explorers search neither, it's normal.

# Explorers

- https://testnet.babylon.explorers.guru/validator/<YOUR_VALORP_ADDRESS>
- https://explorer.kjnodes.com/babylon-testnet

# Checking your wallet balance

```bash
babylond q bank balances <YOUR_ADDRESS>
```

# Querying your validator info (works only after the wait)

```bash
babylond query staking validator <YOUR_VALORP_ADDRESS> --chain-id bbn-test-3
```

# Editing your validator info (works only after the wait)

```bash
babylond tx staking edit-validator \
--identity=592BA308093141B4 \
--chain-id=bbn-test-3 \
--fees=2ubbn \
--from=<YOUR_WALLET_NAME_OR_ADDRESS> \
-y
```

# Monitoring and Management

- Monitoring: Access logs and monitor the node using Docker commands.
- Management: Perform routine node management tasks within the container environment.
- Support For more information, visit the Babylon official documentation or join the Babylon Discord community.

# Other relevant tutorials and resources

Even if it is about andromeda, the commands are more or less the same. Simply replace `andromedad` with `babylond`.
